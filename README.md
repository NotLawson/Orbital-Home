# Orbital Home

Orbital home was a home automation system that I didn't end up making properly work. HomeAssistant was the way.

It was going to be compatible at some point with Orbital, a voice assistant one of made friends made for a programming challenge.

Neither were properly finished, but I'm keeping this here as an example of stuff I did when I was 11.
